# Yags Master

This is a work-in-progress begun November 2024.

The goal is to create a retrieval-augmented generation agent that can run gameplay for the open source tabletop RPG game system "YagsRPG".

You must clone YAGS into the datalake/yags directory. I place a subset of the PDFs in datalake/yags/release/subset which get loaded and can be queried.
